# Project: todo-list
I was not focused on the UI/UX for this project, rather on the functionality:
- create projects and assign todos to them
- edit created todos
- delete todos
- delete projects
- projects and todos are saved across refresh assuming localStorage is enabled on your browser

# Learning objectives
- use classes to generate elements
- separate data from ui
- use localStorage api
- use webpack
